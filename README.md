fruity-background-generator
===========================

Generates data:url in-CSS PNG tileable graphics of stripes.



Status
-------

fruity-background-generator (fsg) is not very usable right now. It doesn't have a "save" functionality,
so you have to copy the images' base64 code using a tool such as firebug.

It also doesn't compress the PNG yet, so it's okay for tiny stripes, but larger ones would benefit greatly from compression.

PNG generation code taken from http://www.xarg.org/2010/03/generate-client-side-png-files-using-javascript/



Dependencies
------------

So far, the only dependency is on the jQuery library.

The generator is being developed and tested on jQuery 1.7.2, but it should work well with other versions.



Roadmap
-------

 - Prepare above mentioned functionality
 - Deploy as a jQuery plugin
 - Test and tweak on every possible browser
 - Put online for public use as a web tool.
