fruity-background-generator
===========================

Generates data:url pngs with stripes.



Status
-------

fruity-background-generator (fsg) is not very usable right now. It doesn't have a "save" functionality,
so you have to copy the images' base64 code using a tool such as firebug.

It also doesn't compress the PNG yet, so it's okay for tiny stripes, but larger ones would benefit greatly from compression.

PNG code generation taken from http://www.xarg.org/2010/03/generate-client-side-png-files-using-javascript/

Roadmap
-------

 - Prepare above mentioned functionality
 - Deploy as a jQuery plugin
 - Test and tweak on every possible browser
 - Put online for public use as a web tool.
